## Introduction
This document describes the social contract for the community around a piece of open source software (“the software”). It lays out the moral and ethical rules the community agrees to in order to ensure a long, healthy, sustainable life for the software.

It is not a legal agreement, although sections of it reference legal agreements. It is a moral and ethical one - it is the foundation upon which the community is built.

By joining the community, you agree to the rules and beliefs outlined in this social contract.

## Principles
We follow the principles of sustainable free and open source communities.

We are a unified body of individuals, scattered throughout the larger society, who work in support of the creation, evolution, use, and extension of the software; while ensuring its longevity through meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of the community of the future to meet its own needs.

We want the software to exist, to solve our problems, to continue to improve, and to be available for our use. Therefore, we commit that we will uphold these four freedoms for all, under all circumstances:

The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1).
The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3).
We do this because:

We believe that software is better when it is produced in the commons.
We believe that sustainable communities are based on just and fair institutions.
We value the ability of every person to use the software to better their own lives.
